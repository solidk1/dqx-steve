# Sync a fork PR to a branch in databrickslabs/dqx and open a test PR.
# Acceptance, anomaly, and performance workflows are skipped for PRs from forks.
# This script pushes the fork's code to a branch in the main repo so those
# tests can run on the new PR.
#
# Usage:
#   .github/scripts/fork-sync-pr.sh <PR_NUMBER>
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - gh CLI installed and authenticated (gh auth login)
#   - Run from a clone of databrickslabs/dqx (or your fork with upstream configured)
#
# First run: Creates fork-test/pr-<N> branch and opens a test PR.
# Subsequent runs: Syncs latest changes from the fork PR to the same branch (force push).

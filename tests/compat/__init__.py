Compatibility patches for test dependencies.

This module applies patches on import - simply importing this module will apply
all necessary compatibility fixes. Import this module BEFORE any imports that
might trigger numba (e.g., shap, sklearn with numba optimizations).

Usage in conftest.py:
    import tests.compat  # noqa: F401  # Apply compatibility patches
